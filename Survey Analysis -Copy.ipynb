She was very helpful. She was very polite, she didn't have the answer to my question, but she put me on hold and asked me to wait courteously and I talked to her manager and she because it's something that needs more tension. She is going to call me back tomorrow and she asked for another backup number or an email address so that in case, I wasn't able to get a hold off and I just want you to know how I go to Acme's.  I called Acme's I go to Acme's for this reason. I haven't been going to you guys very long so I continually get really good customer support extremely good customer support and I've been to home Depot and I'm not going back there because nobody helps you there nobody so I feel like that you guys.

The appliances said and it all worked out very well and totally helpful, especially since I got that very bad experience couple days prior now when I was actually on the phone to register everything we but he was the woman I spoke to was extremely patient was calm and very helpful with everything.   \n2  Well, he had to put me on hold on the telephone to call a different Acme's number to get more information and he kept coming back on the line every 30 seconds to let me know that he still needed to keep me you know on hold and told he could get a hold of somebody that she needed and I thought I was very courteous. I didn't like with everything and he forgot about me. So thank you very much bye.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n3  The things I like best or your when we were putting in the new kitchen your cat program and how knowledgeable the gentleman was who helped us with that and the things I like the least I'm because gotten for every and I've done. They patrol and remote controls and I feel that if the troubles for 20 years and sometimes my because go to a series middle to military ID card is recognized and sometimes it is and of put in a lot of service and I shouldn't have any problems at all getting my military discount fact home Depot does not recognize my because going on so you read ID at all. So I don't shop there anymore. I shop always at Acme's because most of the time they do recognize my military ID, but you have a paper that shows I D's from the various service branches and cause got auxiliary is not on there and it should be we do have a few member is too long to the auxiliary who didn't do anything, but most of us have specific job. Personally has taken the exact same training and qualified for a crew coxen, which is supposed, but kept and and a number of other things to I for sure she qualify for any of those kinds of things.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n4  Yes, my name is Phillip and Condor. I am very satisfied with the Acme's customer service that I have experience, but the know across store. They always professional kind and very very well aware a product knowledge. I am dissatisfied with your menu like trying to I have also stated they need to put in the notes that they never ever come to my residence again, they're very rude unprofessional. I did not want to have any type of service dealings with them, but all to repair the appliances that I was I should purchase from Acme's.  I do not what Norman electronics should be able to do any of my repairs ever again. There when compassionate the Acme's customer service agents District manager's in store staff. Not the most exceptional people and Billy was told to give them any type of Acme's products that is why I travel from one side a child to meet the other side of town to urge in the store in Norcross Georgia when I looked at each point Georgia. I just want to let it be known that that store. I had gave me nothing but professional as them they have resolved my issues with their professional customer service, but I do not want normally electronics to ever come to my home for any repairs for anything that I purchased from Acme's.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n\n   Overall_Satisfaction  label  prediction                       probability  \n0  7                     1      0           [0.533488490962, 0.466511509038]  \n1  7                     1      0           [0.766724744733, 0.233275255267]  \n2  7                     1      0           [0.53279695015, 0.46720304985]    \n3  7                     1      0           [0.591700947139, 0.408299052861]  \n4  7                     1      0           [0.854294932404, 0.145705067596]  "
