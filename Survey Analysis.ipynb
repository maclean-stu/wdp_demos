She executed the call and the order very quickly. Unfortunately again. It was matter that you know that they need to be calling the call center rather than actually find the product at your brick and mortar store was a little discouraging and makes me wonder why I even said to put in your store in the first place.

Don't even give us a call and an hour after the two hour window of six to 8 PM 9 PM we give a call and find the item wasn't even put on a truck and we got no call.

It's the installers. I they gave me first of all I never did receive a phone call the first week from the installer and love the Acme's department store said, someone would call me I purchased it on Monday. They said someone call me on the Thursday, the person didn't call I had to call Acme's back on Saturday to get an installer to call me to schedule the installation that I've already paid for I inside paid for the the the items on the 19th of September and it's today is the third of October and I still haven't received the installation. The installer said, he was going to come. He said he had things going on he did not come when he said he forgot to pick up and that the screen door. He never called me back to reschedule I I was okay with with scheduling a week out from the the week of my purchase and he still didn't show up nor did he call so I had to call the store back last week and and and he was supposed to call me this weekend to schedule and she never did call for ended up calling Acme's store today and she got in contact today. The representative got in contact with the installer and now I am scheduled for this Thursday the sixth of October so I've been waiting for almost three weeks to get a storm door installed and I am five minutes away from the store very very disappointing. I mean, I I experienced the same with the other two items a water softener and she had that I purchased but it was.   \n3  My opinion is that if you can see that someone is having a hard time with your appliance and that their maintenance cost has exceeded the amount of the item original cost. I think that you guys should have a better way to just refund your customers either a with the new Appliance. They sent me know, they do which model that same appliance for just refund that customer entirely this process is very arduous. It was a real big pain in the ***** and I would really like to be done with it and get over with the rest of my life. The fact is that I need to take off from work every time a service ticket for service technician has to come out and this has been a real big problem for me to get this fixed. I don't have all the way to or you know multiple times a week or a month to just take off to get my dishwasher fixed some people have the luxury, but I do not if so I would just like this process to be fixed and to be over with so I can get on with the rest of your life.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n4  Acme's in a situation like this with refrigerators freezers that sort of thing should provide some kind of emergency care. And other words get get the thing fixed as soon as I mean, I mean quick this has been almost were working on Roland of the second week without refrigeration they could provide possibly a online lending program to have a refrigerator they could drop off here. So we could use it temporarily that would be that would be a good thing the number to thing. I think is that they should they should respond to refrigeration problems air conditioning problems that sort of things right away. The drier that I could wait wash machine that can wait, but refrigeration air conditioning something that affects the peoples lives you need to jump on that and get taken care of and and not a lot of stuff or like we've been doing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n\n   Overall_Satisfaction  label  prediction                        probability  \n0  6                     0      0           [0.549440127311, 0.450559872689]   \n1  1                     0      0           [0.547269028928, 0.452730971072]   \n2  2                     0      0           [0.952085658297, 0.0479143417028]  \n3  2                     0      0           [0.596916424912, 0.403083575088]   \n4  1                     0      0           [0.529696837587, 0.470303162413]   ",

However, at the store level the service was something just slightly better than abysmal. It took three Associates before I was even offered the number for the warranty service Center and and initially I was told by your employee that her name was Becky that I would have to contact the manufacturer about my issue even though I purchased a warranty extended warranty and she said she had no idea called what they would say. That is just not it's still a customer experience particular customer with except and up so on the part of your staff for a warranty.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n1  Today's comment that I wanted to leave is actually in regards to the whole experience that I had purchased the extended warranty plan for my washer my dryer and my refrigerator are actually walked into the the Acme's Delaware store number 0622 on on Saturday trying to purchase it and the person I talked to at the counter actually told me I had to go to customer service went to customer service and the gentleman who actually exact customer service had to get page because he wasn't of this post when he got there. He was extremely rude and although I was told that I could get the extended warranty plan. He was telling me I could not get it because of the fact that I purchased these the claim to got a different location and he told me I had to have the credit card purchased it with a long with the receipt and I had to purchase it that specific store. So course I was today. However, I did call that store back just to get a call permission and I actually was talking to a different gentleman who works in the appliances department. His name is Tom gave him the whole situation. He was extremely helpful told me I could come into the store and purchased the plan. So I did so then he told me that I had to call the customer service number for a claim started except reach order to register the extended warranty for all of these devices. I was extremely satisfied with Tom helped because of the fact that I was able to get what I wanted what he was saying matched up to exactly what the sales associate sold me. The appliances said and it all worked out very well and totally helpful, especially since I got that very bad experience couple days prior now when I was actually on the phone to register everything we but he was the woman I spoke to was extremely patient was calm and very helpful with everything.   \n2  Well, he had to put me on hold on the telephone to call a different Acme's number to get more information and he kept coming back on the line every 30 seconds to let me know that he still needed to keep me you know on hold and told he could get a hold of somebody that she needed and I thought I was very courteous. I didn't like with everything and he forgot about me. So thank you very much bye.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n3  The things I like best or your when we were putting in the new kitchen your cat program and how knowledgeable the gentleman was who helped us with that and the things I like the least I'm because gotten for every and I've done. They patrol and remote controls and I feel that if the troubles for 20 years and sometimes my because go to a series middle to military ID card is recognized and sometimes it is and of put in a lot of service and I shouldn't have any problems at all getting my military discount fact home Depot does not recognize my because going on so you read ID at all. So I don't shop there anymore. I shop always at Acme's because most of the time they do recognize my military ID, but you have a paper that shows I D's from the various service branches and cause got auxiliary is not on there and it should be we do have a few member is too long to the auxiliary who didn't do anything, but most of us have specific job. Personally has taken the exact same training and qualified for a crew coxen, which is supposed, but kept and and a number of other things to I for sure she qualify for any of those kinds of things.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n4  Yes, my name is Phillip and Condor. I am very satisfied with the Acme's customer service that I have experience, but the know across store. They always professional kind and very very well aware a product knowledge. I am dissatisfied with your menu like trying to I have also stated they need to put in the notes that they never ever come to my residence again, they're very rude unprofessional. I did not want to have any type of service dealings with them, but all to repair the appliances that I was I should purchase from Acme's.  I do not what Norman electronics should be able to do any of my repairs ever again. There when compassionate the Acme's customer service agents District manager's in store staff. Not the most exceptional people and Billy was told to give them any type of Acme's products that is why I travel from one side a child to meet the other side of town to urge in the store in Norcross Georgia when I looked at each point Georgia. I just want to let it be known that that store. I had gave me nothing but professional as them they have resolved my issues with their professional customer service, but I do not want normally electronics to ever come to my home for any repairs for anything that I purchased from Acme's.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n\n   Overall_Satisfaction  label  prediction                       probability  \n0  7                     1      0           [0.533488490962, 0.466511509038]  \n1  7                     1      0           [0.766724744733, 0.233275255267]  \n2  7                     1      0           [0.53279695015, 0.46720304985]    \n3  7                     1      0           [0.591700947139, 0.408299052861]  \n4  7                     1      0           [0.854294932404, 0.145705067596]  ",
